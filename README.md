This task involves creating a basic React Native application that displays a text message with a colored background.

Functionality:

The application will display a single screen with the following elements:
A central container (View) that fills the entire screen (flex: 1).
Text displayed within the container, stating "My name is Ago Joel".
A status bar displayed at the top of the screen (optional, depending on platform specifics). The status bar style is set to "auto" by default.

Styling:

The container (View) will have the following styles applied:
Background color set to a light gray shade (#a0a0a0).
Content horizontally centered (alignItems: 'center').
Content vertically centered (justifyContent: 'center').

Expected Outcome:

The application should display a single screen with a light gray background and the text "My name is Ago Joel" centered in both horizontal and vertical directions. If the platform supports a status bar, it will be displayed at the top with the default style.
